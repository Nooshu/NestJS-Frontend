# Project standards

- Keep Node.js and npm versions current and reflected in the `engines` field; engine ranges can be used if required.
- Keep `.npmrc` and `.nvmrc` aligned with Node.js and npm versions.
- Prefer patch and minor dependency updates unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Pin dependency versions and preserve lockfile integrity.
- Verify package integrity and avoid introducing breaking changes.
- Always run tests after dependency changes.
- Summaries must include risks and unresolved issues.
