# NestJS Monorepo Architecture

## Overview

A NestJS monorepo is a project structure that contains multiple NestJS applications or libraries within a single repository. This architecture allows teams to manage related projects together while maintaining their independence and reusability.

## Benefits of NestJS Monorepo

1. **Code Sharing and Reusability**
   - Share common code, utilities, and types across multiple applications
   - Maintain consistent business logic and validation rules
   - Reduce code duplication and improve maintainability

2. **Simplified Dependency Management**
   - Centralised package management
   - Consistent versioning across projects
   - Easier updates and security patches

3. **Improved Development Workflow**
   - Single repository for related projects
   - Unified testing and build processes
   - Easier code review and collaboration

4. **Better Project Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular architecture
   - Easier to understand project boundaries

## Project Structure

A typical NestJS monorepo structure looks like this:

```
monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/                 # Main API application
│   ├── admin/              # Admin panel application
│   └── worker/             # Background worker application
├── libs/
│   ├── common/             # Shared utilities and helpers
│   ├── database/           # Database related code
│   └── auth/               # Authentication module
├── package.json
└── nest-cli.json
```

## Setting Up a NestJS Monorepo

1. **Initialise the Project**
   ```bash
   nest new monorepo
   cd monorepo
   ```

2. **Configure nest-cli.json**
   ```json
   {
     "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
     "monorepo": true,
     "root": "apps/api",
     "sourceRoot": "apps/api/src",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "webpack": true,
       "tsConfigPath": "apps/api/tsconfig.app.json"
     },
     "projects": {
       "api": {
         "type": "application",
         "root": "apps/api",
         "entryFile": "main",
         "sourceRoot": "apps/api/src",
         "compilerOptions": {
           "tsConfigPath": "apps/api/tsconfig.app.json"
         }
       },
       "admin": {
         "type": "application",
         "root": "apps/admin",
         "entryFile": "main",
         "sourceRoot": "apps/admin/src",
         "compilerOptions": {
           "tsConfigPath": "apps/admin/tsconfig.app.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create New Applications**
   ```bash
   nest generate app admin
   nest generate app worker
   ```

4. **Create Shared Libraries**
   ```bash
   nest generate library common
   nest generate library database
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Module Organization**
   - Keep shared modules in the `libs` directory
   - Each application should be self-contained
   - Use clear naming conventions for modules and services

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Use workspace dependencies in package.json
   - Keep shared dependencies at the root level
   - Use specific versions for application-specific dependencies

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write unit tests for shared libraries
   - Implement integration tests for each application
   - Use shared test utilities and mocks

4. **Build and Deployment**
   - Configure separate build processes for each application
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Implement proper CI/CD pipelines

## Common Use Cases

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Each application can be a separate microservice
   - Shared libraries for common functionality
   - Easy service discovery and communication

2. **Multi-tenant Applications**
   - Separate applications for different tenants
   - Shared authentication and authorization
   - Common business logic and utilities

3. **API Gateway Pattern**
   - Main API application as the gateway
   - Separate applications for different domains
   - Shared validation and transformation logic

## Conclusion

NestJS monorepo architecture provides a powerful way to organize and manage multiple related applications. It promotes code reuse, simplifies dependency management, and improves development workflow. By following best practices and proper organization, teams can create maintainable and scalable applications that are easy to develop and deploy.
