  - Creates manifest file mapping original paths to fingerprinted paths
  - Template function for resolving paths
  - Special handling for various asset types

- **Caching Strategy**
  - Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

  - Immutable flag prevents revalidation
  - ETags and Last-Modified headers for conditional requests

- **Benefits**
  - Significantly faster repeat visits
  - Reduced bandwidth usage
