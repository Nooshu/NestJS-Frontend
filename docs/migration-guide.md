# Migration Guide: Express.js to NestJS

This document provides a structured approach to migrating from the [HMCTS Express.js template](https://github.com/hmcts/expressjs-template) to this NestJS-based solution.

## Migration Strategies

### Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)

This approach involves gradually migrating services while maintaining both systems in parallel.

#### Steps:
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Deploy the NestJS application alongside the existing Express.js application
   - Use feature flags to control which system handles requests
   - Share the same database and external service connections

2. **Service-by-Service Migration**
   - Migrate one service/endpoint at a time
   - Use feature flags to route traffic to either system
   - Validate functionality in the new system before switching
   - Monitor performance and error rates

3. **Complete Switchover**
   - Once all services are migrated and validated
   - Remove feature flags
   - Decommission Express.js application

#### Benefits:
- Minimal downtime
- Ability to roll back individual services
- Continuous service availability
- Time to validate each component

#### Considerations:
- Requires maintaining two systems temporarily
- Need for careful traffic management
- Additional infrastructure costs during transition

### Option 2: Big Bang Migration

This approach involves a complete switch from Express.js to NestJS in one deployment.

#### Steps:
1. **Preparation**
   - Complete migration of all services in development
   - Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Documentation updates

2. **Deployment**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Deploy NestJS application
   - Switch DNS/routing to new application
   - Monitor for issues

#### Benefits:
- Faster overall migration
- No need to maintain two systems
- Clean break from old system

#### Considerations:
- Higher risk
- Requires maintenance window
- More complex rollback process
- All services must be ready simultaneously

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

This approach maintains both systems but routes different types of traffic to each.

#### Steps:
1. **Traffic Analysis**
   - Identify high-risk vs low-risk services
   - Determine which services can be migrated first
   - Plan routing strategy

2. **Selective Migration**
   - Migrate low-risk services first
   - Route specific traffic patterns to NestJS
   - Gradually increase NestJS traffic

3. **Complete Migration**
   - Migrate remaining services
   - Switch all traffic to NestJS
   - Decommission Express.js

#### Benefits:
- Risk can be managed by service type
- No complete system downtime
- Flexible migration timeline

#### Considerations:
- Complex routing setup
- Need for careful monitoring
- Potential for inconsistent user experience

## Migration Checklist

1. **Assessment Phase** (2-4 weeks)
   - Evaluate current system
   - Identify migration requirements
   - Choose migration approach

2. **Preparation Phase** (4-8 weeks)
   - Set up development environment
   - Create migration plan
   - Prepare testing environment

3. **Migration Phase** (8-16 weeks)
   - Execute chosen migration strategy
   - Regular testing and validation
   - Performance monitoring

4. **Stabilization Phase** (2-4 weeks)
   - Monitor system performance
   - Address any issues
   - Optimize as needed

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Maintain comprehensive logging
   - Implement circuit breakers
   - Set up monitoring and alerts
   - Create rollback procedures

2. **Business Risks**
   - Schedule migrations during low-traffic periods
   - Maintain clear communication with stakeholders
   - Have support team on standby
   - Document all changes

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**
   - Response times within SLA
   - No degradation in service quality
   - Successful handling of peak loads

2. **Functionality**
   - All features working as expected
   - No regression in existing functionality
   - Successful integration with all systems

3. **User Experience**
   - No disruption to user workflows
   - Maintained or improved accessibility
   - Consistent behavior across all services
