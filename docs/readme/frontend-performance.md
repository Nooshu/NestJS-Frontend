# Frontend Performance

This document outlines the frontend performance features and optimizations implemented in the application.

## Overview

The application includes comprehensive frontend performance optimizations to ensure fast loading times, efficient resource usage, and a great user experience. These optimizations are implemented through various tools and techniques, including Webpack, PostCSS, Service Workers, and performance monitoring.

## Performance Monitoring

### Core Metrics
The application implements comprehensive performance monitoring with the following metrics:

- **Navigation Timing**
  - DNS lookup time
  - TCP connection time
  - Server response time
  - DOM processing time
  - Page load time
  - First byte time
  - DOM interactive time
  - DOM content loaded time
  - Redirect time
  - App cache time
  - Unload event time

- **Resource Timing**
  - Resource load duration
  - Resource size
  - Resource type
  - Start and end times
  - DNS lookup time
  - TCP connection time
  - Server response time
  - Large resource detection

- **User Interaction**
  - First input delay
  - Processing start time
  - Interaction duration
  - Target element
  - Interaction ID

- **Visual Performance**
  - Largest contentful paint
  - First contentful paint
  - Layout shifts
  - Cumulative layout shift
  - Time to interactive
  - Total blocking time

### Monitoring Service
The application includes a dedicated performance monitoring service that provides:

- Configurable sampling rate
- Maximum entries limit
- Periodic reporting
- On-page-unload reporting
- Error handling
- Metrics storage
- Development mode support

### Configuration Options
The performance monitoring service can be configured with:

```javascript
performanceService.setConfig({
  reportingEndpoint: '/api/performance-metrics',
  sampleRate: 0.5, // Sample 50% of page loads
  maxEntries: 100,
  isReportingEnabled: true
});
```

### Usage Examples
Access performance metrics:

```javascript
// Get all metrics
const metrics = performanceService.getMetrics();

// Get specific metric
const navigationMetrics = performanceService.getMetric('navigation');

// Monitor specific metrics
performanceMonitor.addObserver((type, data) => {
  if (type === 'largestContentfulPaint') {
    console.log('Largest Contentful Paint:', data);
  }
});
```

## Build Optimization

### Webpack Configuration
The application uses Webpack for efficient bundling and optimization of frontend assets. Key features include:

- Code splitting for better performance
- CSS optimization with PostCSS
- Asset optimization and minification
- Automatic asset versioning
- Development and production builds
- Source maps for debugging
- Optimized view engine configuration
  - Autoescaping for security
  - Environment-based caching
  - Template optimization
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Error handling
- Efficient route handling
  - Logical route organization
  - Middleware optimization
  - Route-specific middleware
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error handling

### CSS Optimization
CSS is optimized using PostCSS with the following features:

- Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility
- CSS minification with cssnano
- Removal of unused CSS
- Optimization of CSS values
- Normalization of whitespace
- Minification of font values and gradients

### JavaScript Optimization
JavaScript is optimized using Babel and Terser:

- Modern JavaScript transpilation
- Code minification
- Tree shaking for unused code removal
- Source map generation for debugging
- Module bundling for efficient loading

## Caching and Offline Support

### Service Worker
The application implements a service worker for offline support and caching:

- Cache-first strategy for static assets
- Offline fallback support
- Cache versioning and cleanup
- Automatic cache updates
- Efficient asset caching

### Cache Configuration
The service worker is configured to cache:

- Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- GOV.UK Frontend assets
- Application icons and logos
- Offline fallback pages

## Asset Optimization

### Image Optimization
Images are optimized for web delivery:

- Automatic image optimization
- Responsive image support
- Lazy loading of images
- WebP format support
- Image compression

### Font Optimization
Fonts are optimized for performance:

- Font subsetting
- WOFF2 format support
- Font display optimization
- Font loading strategies
- Font fallback handling

## Development Workflow

### Build Commands
The following commands are available for frontend development:

```bash
# Development build
npm run build:frontend

# Production build
npm run build:frontend:prod

# Watch mode for development
npm run build:frontend:watch
```

### Development Tools
The following tools are used for frontend development:

- Webpack for bundling
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Babel for JavaScript transpilation
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting

## Best Practices

### Performance Guidelines
Follow these guidelines for optimal performance:

1. Use code splitting for large applications
2. Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
3. Optimize images before deployment
4. Use the service worker for offline support
5. Monitor performance metrics in production
6. Keep dependencies up to date
7. Use production builds for deployment
8. Implement proper caching strategies
9. Optimize CSS and JavaScript
10. Use performance monitoring tools

### Optimization Tips
Additional tips for performance optimization:

1. Minimize HTTP requests
2. Use efficient caching strategies
3. Optimize critical rendering path
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Use efficient data structures
6. Optimize third-party scripts
7. Implement proper loading strategies
8. Use efficient CSS selectors
9. Optimize JavaScript execution
10. Implement proper error boundaries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
Solutions for common performance issues:

1. Slow page load times
   - Check network requests
   - Optimize critical resources
   - Implement proper caching
   - Use code splitting

2. High memory usage
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Optimize resource loading
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Use efficient data structures

3. Slow JavaScript execution
