/**
 * CLI script to fingerprint static assets.
 * 
 * This script is used as part of the build process to generate content-based hashes
 * for static assets and create a manifest file for runtime asset path resolution.
 * 
 * The script:
 * 1. Initializes the FingerprintService
 * 2. Calls its fingerprint() method to process all assets
 * 3. Outputs simple logging messages to the console
 * 
 * This is typically run as part of the build:frontend npm script after the CSS
 * compilation and asset copying steps have completed.
 * 
 * @see FingerprintService for the implementation details of the fingerprinting process
