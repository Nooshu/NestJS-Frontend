## When to Choose Express.js + TypeScript

While NestJS offers many advantages, Express.js + TypeScript might be more suitable when:
- Building very small applications or prototypes
- Need maximum flexibility and minimal overhead
- Team is already familiar with Express.js
- Project has specific requirements that don't benefit from NestJS's architecture

## Conclusion

NestJS provides a more structured and feature-rich framework compared to Express.js + TypeScript, making it particularly suitable for:
- Enterprise applications
- Large-scale projects
- Teams working on long-term maintainable codebases
- Projects requiring strong architectural patterns
- Applications that need to scale

The initial investment in learning NestJS's architecture and patterns pays off in terms of code maintainability, scalability, and development efficiency, especially for larger projects.
