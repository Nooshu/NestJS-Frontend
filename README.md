# PoC: NestJS Frontend Application

A proof of concept (PoC) for a HMCTS NestJS application with GOV.UK Frontend integration, designed to replace the existing [HMCTS Express.js template](https://github.com/hmcts/expressjs-template).

:rotating_light: **Note**: This proof of concept (PoC) is not currently intended for exclusive use with ExUI. Its integration with ExUI is a longer-term objective, dependent on the future decentralisation of CCD. :rotating_light:

## Super Quick Start guide

### Development Mode
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with hot reload (automatically builds and watches frontend assets)
npm run start:dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production (includes frontend assets)
npm run build:prod

# Start production server
npm run start:prod
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (unit, integration, GOV.UK, and E2E)
npm run test:all

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run GOV.UK component tests
npm run test:govuk

# Run end-to-end tests in all browsers
npm run test:e2e:browsers

# Run end-to-end tests locally (with proper setup)
npm run test:e2e:local

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:cov
```

### Running with Docker

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Prepare the project for Docker build (recommended)
./scripts/prepare-docker.sh

# Build the Docker image
docker-compose build

# Run the application
docker-compose up

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Build and run in development mode
docker-compose --profile dev up frontend-dev

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose --profile dev up -d frontend-dev
```

#### Accessing the Application
Once the container is running, you can access the application at:
- **Production**: https://localhost:3100
- **Development**: https://localhost:3101

The application will serve a basic home page with GOV.UK Frontend styling.

#### Docker Commands
```bash
# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build

# Clean up containers and images
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans
```

The application uses a clear separation of test types:

- **Unit and Integration Tests** (`test/` directory)
  - Jest-based tests for individual components and their interactions
  - Files must end with `.spec.ts`
  - Run with `npm run test:unit` or `npm run test:integration`

- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/` directory)
  - Playwright-based tests for complete user journeys
  - Tests for homepage, health checks, and navigation
  - Run with `npm run test:e2e` or browser-specific commands
  - Use `npm run test:e2e:local` for local development with proper setup

## Asset Fingerprinting

This project implements static asset fingerprinting without using bundlers like Webpack. Fingerprinting adds a content hash to filenames (e.g., `main.a1b2c3d4.css`), which enables efficient browser caching while ensuring users always get the latest version when files change.

In templates, use the `assetPath` function to resolve paths to fingerprinted assets:

```nunjucks
<link href="{{ assetPath('/css/main.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
<img src="{{ assetPath('/images/logo.png') }}" alt="Logo">
<script src="{{ assetPath('/js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

Key benefits:
- Long-term caching (1 year) with immutable flag for optimal performance
- No revalidation requests when users refresh the page
- Automatic cache busting when content changes
- No complex bundler configuration required
