# PoC: NestJS Frontend Application

A proof of concept (PoC) for a HMCTS NestJS application with GOV.UK Frontend integration, designed to replace the existing [HMCTS Express.js template](https://github.com/hmcts/expressjs-template).

:rotating_light: **Note**: This PoC is not intended for use with ExUI at this stage; its application is envisioned as a future goal of the project. :rotating_light:

## Project Overview

- Comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics
- Enhanced security features
- Response compression and browser caching
- Optimized middleware chain
- Static asset fingerprinting for optimal cache performance
- Microservices architecture support

## Asset Fingerprinting

This project implements static asset fingerprinting without using bundlers like Webpack. Fingerprinting adds a content hash to filenames (e.g., `main.a1b2c3d4.css`), which enables efficient browser caching while ensuring users always get the latest version when files change.

In templates, use the `assetPath` function to resolve paths to fingerprinted assets:

```nunjucks
<link href="{{ assetPath('/css/main.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
<img src="{{ assetPath('/images/logo.png') }}" alt="Logo">
<script src="{{ assetPath('/js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

Key benefits:
- Long-term caching (1 year) with immutable flag for optimal performance
- No revalidation requests when users refresh the page
- Automatic cache busting when content changes
- No complex bundler configuration required
